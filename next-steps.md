# Next steps

Hopefully this guide has given you a few good frames of reference for thinking about progressive tech and how you can play a role in the industry. How you want to proceed depends a little on the amount of effort you want to put in, and your answers to some of the other questions above.

If you are completely new to politics, there is nothing quite like jumping in with both feet and learning about the system from within. Volunteering for a campaign is easy and relatively low-stakes, but it gives you a very tangible appreciation for the way politics works.

Once you've gotten a bit of experience, try getting involved with an organization like [Ragtag](https://ragtag.org/) or [Digidems](https://www.digidems.com/), even if you eventually intend to dedicate a lot of time - perhaps even a significant chunk of your career - to progressive tech. These are great organizations that can plug you in to some very exciting projects, right off the bat.

For a taste of yet more dedicated involvement, the most conventional choice is to seek out a job at one of the many, many progressive tech organizations looking to hire. Somewhat less beaten paths \(although potentially very rewarding ones\) include contribution to open source projects, and starting up a new venture.

Whichever path you choose, best of luck! And by all means feel free to add your wisdom to this guide for others who wish to chip in.
